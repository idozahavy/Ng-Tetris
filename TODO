instructions:
gets faster every line removal(speed increases only by one), 
raising the difficulty level increases both the speed increments and max speed,
first line = 20 points
after the first line there is a bonus of 10 points more than the previous
3 lines = 20 + (20 + 10) + ((20 + 10) + 10)
points for tetris(4 lines) = 140
e.g: tetris makes only one speed increment.
